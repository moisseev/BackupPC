QUICK START:
-----------

The latest version of BackupPC can be fetched from:

    http://backuppc.sourceforge.net

If you will use SMB for WinXX clients, you will need smbclient and
nmblookup from the Samba distribution.  Version >= 2.2.0 of Samba is
recommended (smbclient's tar feature in 2.0.7 has bugs for certain
path lengths).  See www.samba.org for source and binaries.

If you use rsync you will need File::RsyncP on SourceForge or www.cpan.org,
plus rsync 2.5.6 on the client machines.

To install BackupPC run these commands as root:

    tar zxf BackupPC-3.3.0.tar.gz
    cd BackupPC-3.3.0
    perl configure.pl

This will automatically determine some system information and prompt you
for install paths.  Do "perldoc configure.pl" to see the various options
that configure.pl provides.

INTRODUCTION:
------------

BackupPC is a high-performance, enterprise-grade system for backing
up Linux, WinXX, and MacOS PCs and laptops to a server's disk.
BackupPC is highly configurable and easy to install and maintain.

Given the ever decreasing cost of disks and raid systems, it is now
practical and cost effective to backup a large number of machines onto
a server's local disk or network storage. This is what BackupPC does.
For some sites, this might be the complete backup solution. For other
sites, additional permanent archives could be created by periodically
backing up the server to tape.  A variety of Open Source systems are
available for doing backup to tape.

BackupPC is written in Perl and extracts backup data via SMB (using Samba),
rsync, or tar over ssh/rsh/nfs.  It is robust, reliable, well documented
and freely available as Open Source on SourceForge.

FEATURES:
--------

  - A clever pooling scheme minimizes disk storage and disk IO. Identical
    files across multiple backups of the same or different PCs are stored
    only once resulting in substantial savings in disk storage.

  - One example of disk use: 95 latops with each full backup averaging
    3.6GB each, and each incremental averaging about 0.3GB.  Storing
    three weekly full backups and six incremental backups per laptop
    is around 1200GB of raw data, but because of pooling and compression
    only 150GB is needed.

  - No client-side software is needed.  The standard smb protocol is used
    to extract backup data on WinXX clients.  On *nix clients, either rsync
    or tar over ssh/rsh/nfs is used to backup the data.  Various alternatives
    are possible: rsync can also be used with WinXX by running rsyncd/cygwin.
    Similarly, smb could be used to backup *nix file systems if they are
    exported as smb shares.

  - A powerful http/cgi user interface allows administrators to view log
    files, configuration, current status and allows users to initiate and
    cancel backups and browse and restore files from backups.

  - Flexible restore options.  Single files can be downloaded from
    any backup directly from the CGI interface.  Zip or Tar archives
    for selected files or directories from any backup can also be
    downloaded from the CGI interface.  Finally, direct restore to
    the client machine (using SMB, rsync or tar) for selected files
    or directories is also supported from the CGI interface.

  - Supports mobile environments where laptops are only intermittently
    connected to the network and have dynamic IP addresses (DHCP).

  - Flexible configuration parameters allow multiple backups to be performed
    in parallel, specification of which shares to backup, which directories
    to backup or not backup, various schedules for full and incremental
    backups, schedules for email reminders to users and so on.  Configuration
    parameters can be set system-wide or also on a per-PC basis.

  - Users are sent periodic email reminders if their PC has not
    recently been backed up.  Email content, timing and policies
    are configurable.

  - Tested on Linux and Solaris hosts, and Linux, Win95, Win98, Win2000
    and WinXP clients.

  - Detailed documentation.

  - Open Source hosted by SourceForge and freely available under GPL.
