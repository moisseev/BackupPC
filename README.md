BackupPC
========

This is a BackupPC unofficial repository to collect bug fixes and additional features during mainstream developer timeout. Hopefully one day some changes from this repository will be merged into mainstream distribution.

Branch descriptions
========

_Main branches_ - bug fixes and new features    
**master-v3**    
**master-v4**

_Feature branches_    
**pool-graphs-v3** - Adds pool graphs to the status page. Even though it is an optional part of FreeBSD port sysutils/backuppc since Apr 2013, this feature should be considered experimental. Since the graphs are not included in BackupPC v3, RRD format may be changed in future BackupPC versions.

_Clones of BackupPC source code_
