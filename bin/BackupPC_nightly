# BackupPC_nightly: Nightly cleanup & statistics script.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   BackupPC_nightly performs several administrative tasks:
#
#      - monthly aging of per-PC log files (only with -m option)
#
#      - pruning files from pool no longer used (ie: those with only one
#        hard link).
#
#      - sending email to users and administrators (only with -m option)
#
#   Usage: BackupPC_nightly [-m] poolRangeStart poolRangeEnd
#
#   Flags:
#
#     -m   Do monthly aging of per-PC log files and sending of email.
#          Otherise, BackupPC_nightly just does pool pruning.
#          Since several BackupPC_nightly processes might run
#          concurrently, just the first one is given the -m flag
#          by BackupPC.
#
#   The poolRangeStart and poolRangeEnd arguments are integers from 0 to 255.
#   These specify which parts of the pool to process.  There are 256 2nd-level
#   directories in the pool (0/0, 0/1, ..., f/e, f/f).  BackupPC_nightly
#   processes the given subset of this list (0 means 0/0, 255 means f/f).
#   Therefore, arguments of 0 255 process the entire pool, 0 127 does
#   the first half (ie: 0/0 through 7/f), 127 255 does the other half
#   (eg: 8/0 through f/f) and 0 15 does just the first 1/16 of the pool
#   (ie: 0/0 through 0/f).
